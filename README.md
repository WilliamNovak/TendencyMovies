# Movies Site
Website that shows a list of trending movies at the moment, developed with Vue for a company test.

The application was developed using <b>'The Movie DB' API</b>.

<h3>Functionalities:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>HomePage with the top 20 movies of the moment, based on people's trending on the API;</li>
  <li>The movies are sorted by rating;</li>
  <li>Modal dialog with the movie description, genres and informations;</li>
  <li>Search bar to search for the name of the movie.</li>
</ul>

This was my first time with Vue and I like the result. However, it's open to future changes.
